<!-- In order to design this app, I adjusted the original design, such as increasing the wireframe to make the whole more concise, using darker colors to make it more serious, and adding some icons in some places to make it easier to watch and use.
I put the navigation bar on top of the layout, making the interface more user-friendly, and added the corresponding icons to make it easier for users to use. There is some better interactivity.
Based on the feedback from last time, I built a perfect homepage. It includes a task list, a stopwatch timer and a music player. Students can adjust their tasks to tweak in the ongoing tasks to define what they need; in turn, they can choose their completion date and also set the priority. I take into account the completed tasks and can show the completed tasks on the Completed Tasks page. Then for the students who need to rest after studying, I added a timer and a music player, so that they can study effectively and relax themselves well, so that they can combine work and rest. In addition, some minor secondary functions are added to meet the additional needs of students.
I used the Consistency and standards principle in my design to ensure that the colors of the pages, the consistency of the interactions, and the other components were all kept consistent. The above design also involves the principle of Aesthetic and minimalist design, which makes the overall look not too simple and boring and has some aesthetic value. Finally, there is the Help and documentation principle, which is used to guide students in storing data and guiding them to use the app to accomplish the tasks they want.
